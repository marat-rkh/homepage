### PLFArend

During my time in Arend, I was reading the ["Programming Language Foundations in Agda"](https://plfa.github.io/) book to refresh my knowlegde of theorem prooving. To actually learn something, you need to get your hands dirty, so I was rewriting the code snippets in Arend. The book is a collection of Markdown files with code snippets in Agda, and by adding Arend snippets along side the original ones, I was getting a version of PLFA where you can compare the same proofs in different languages. 

I finished the first chapter (out of three), and put it on hold for quite some time. It was just a personal project that very few people knew about. But this April, to my great surprise, I was reached by Philip Wadler, the author of the PLFA. One of the former members of the Arend team mentioned my project to professor Wadler, and he suggested to mention it on the book's website as a derived work! [You can find it there now!](https://plfa.github.io/#derived-works)

Not gonna lie, this made me very happy. It is not often when your small personal project gets this kind of recongnition from a famous person. This could be the highest achievement in my failed career as a scientist ðŸ˜‚ Even before this I was thinking about doing some theorem prooving in my spare time just because I like it. But now I am even more motivated. Should finish the PLFArend, there are two chapters ahead!
